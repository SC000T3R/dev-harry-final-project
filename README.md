# NameWich

### I had this idea a couple years ago during my freshman year of college
### Ideally, I would order a customized sandwich from a sub shop online and then it would forever be attatched to my name for future orders
### This is some of the rudamentary outline for what it would look like to fill out a form and have it retain your suggestions to its database

## Primary Purpose
This application is designed to collect information from a central object: customized sandwich, and hold this information until it is later needed.

## Outline
This app consists of responsive drop down menus, user-input boxes, and custom toggle buttons to retrieve user information. Additionally, there is a responsive button to allow confirmation that user information has been recieved. If you want to use the app you must fill out all of the boxes or options for input; otherwise, an error is initiated letting the user know there are fields left open.
